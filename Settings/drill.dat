# This file specifies the N/C drill output format options.
# The file is divided into two sections:-
# 1) Drill Listing - which determines the format of the Drill Listing file.
# 2) N/C Drill - which determines the format of the output file to drive the
#    actual drill machine.
# Each section has a header of the form: $<Section Name>.
# The sections can be in any order but the section name must be preceeded by
# a "$" character in the 1st column of a line.
# Currently the only valid section names are "Drill Listing" and "N/C Drill".
# Comments such as these may appear anywhere in the file so long as they
# start with a "#" character in the 1st column.
#
# Each format option is identified by a 3 character mnemonic followed by a
# colon ":".
# A format option will either take a numeric value or a format string
# immediately following the colon.
# A format string specifies the exact text to be used within the drill
# command that it is defining.
# Format strings may contain the character "@" which indicates that a
# numeric value or other data will be inserted at this point by the N/C Drill
# software.
# The character immediately following the "@" specifies the type of data to
# be inserted as follows:-
#	@u - Units                 - valid in SDF: only.
#	@l - Leading digits        - valid in SDF: only.
#	@m - Trailing digits       - valid in SDF: only.
#	@0 - Zero suppression      - valid in SDF: only.
#	@d - Drill size            - valid in STS: only.
#	@t - Tool number           - valid in STS: only.
#	@f - Drill feed rate       - valid in STS: only.
#	@s - Drill speed           - valid in STS: only.
#	@x - Drill X co-ordinate   - valid in XYC: and SRC: only.
#	@y - Drill Y co-ordinate   - valid in XYC: and SRC: only.
#	@c - Drill coordinates		- valid in SDC: only.
#	@z - Drill X/Y co-ordinate value          - valid in DXC: and DYC: only.
#	@r - Step & Repeat section (if selected)  - valid in ETS: or EDF: only.
#	@n - Start new line in output file        - valid in any format string.
#
# Note: the N/C Drill software only supplies the data types listed above.
#		  Any additional commands such as Rewind commands, Swap or Mirror
#		  axes commands must be inserted by the user in the apropriate format
#		  string.  The user should refer to his N/C Drill machine manual for
#		  details.
#
# The format options are as follows:-
#	EIA: - Numeric value: 0 = ASCII output, 1 = EIA RS-244 output code.
#	MET: - Numeric value: 0 = English units, 1 = Metric units.
#	PRE: - Numeric value: number of fractional digits in co-ordinates
#			 assuming English units of inches or Metric units of millimetres.
#	NDG: - Numeric value: total number of significant digits in co-ordinates.
#	LTZ: - Numeric value: 0 = no zero suppression, 1 = suppress leading zeros,
#			 2 = suppress trailing zeros.
#	INC: - Numeric value: 0 = absolute co-ordinates, 1 = incremental coords.
#	RPT: - Numeric value: 0 = no suppression, 1 = suppress repeated coords.
#	SDF: - Format string: commands for start of drill file.
#	STS: - Format string: commands for start of tool section.
#	XYC: - Format string: commands for drill hole co-ordinates.
#	DXC: - Format string: commands for drill hole X co-ordinate.
#	DYC: - Format string: commands for drill hole Y co-ordinate.
#	SDC: - Format string: commands for slotted drill hole co-ordinates.
#	ETS: - Format string: commands for end of tool section.
#	EDF: - Format string: commands for end of drill file.
#	SSR: - Format string: commands for start of Step & Repeat section.
#	SRC: - Format string: commands for Step & Repeat offset co-ordinates.
#	ESR: - Format string: commands for end of Step & Repeat section.
